Hi
This is meant to be a backend for our maps app.
If you want to understand how this works. I would first read the mapmodels.js file in
the models folder. It has the Mongo Schemas which show how the data is formatted.
After that I would read the index.js file in the src folder. This where all the requests (GET, POST, and other stuff)
is written.

First do 

npm install 

the first time you pull this code. Then whenever you want to run the server do 

npm run dev

Happy Coding!

Sincerely,
Anmol
